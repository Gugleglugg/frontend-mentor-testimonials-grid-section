### What I learned

This was my first ever grid project! The trickiest part was when the cards within the same row were refusing to be the same height and somehow I couldn't google the answer instantly. But then I realized I should have set the height to 100% and boom, problem fixed.

I also learned quite a bit about the z-index.
